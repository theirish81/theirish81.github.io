Software architect, software engineer, hardcore coder, but more than anything
else, hardcore geek.

Born and raised in Italy, I succeeded at not leaving my country in the great
IT specialists' diaspora, more for the sake of the challenge than for the
roots.

Entrepreneur once, and GOD-FORBID-NEVER-AGAIN, after 20 years of professional
experience, I still enjoy software design and development to the point that it
is still my main hobby in my spare time.

## My toys
C++ and Java were my first loves, then Scala. Nowadays, my favourite combo is:
**Golang** and **TypeScript**.

I love **microservices**, **distributed architectures**, especially when 
**event driven**.

Possibly a little late to the **Kubernetes game**, it's now part a vital part
of my tool belt.

## What I code in my spare time
So here in GitHub you'll mostly find stuff that I code for the pleasure of it.
I generally like to work on:
* Command-line utilities: they're tiny, useful and fun
* Libraries: it's always fun and rewarding to build stuff that helps other
  fellow coders
* Gateways: I don't know why, but it's always been a bit of an obsession for me


## Some of my projects
All projects I'm listing here are open source.

### Utilities
* [RedProbe](https://github.com/theirish81/redProbe): a probe to test HTTP(S)
  endpoints. It measures key metrics, evaluates status codes an supports simple
  assertions.
* [RedRabbit](https://github.com/theirish81/redRabbit): a simple client for
  RabbitMQ, acting either as publisher or consumer and performing actions based
  on simple configuration files. Useful to validate the behaviour of RabbitMQ
  topologies in the design phase.

### Libraries
* [YamlRef](https://github.com/theirish81/yamlRef) (**Golang**): An easy Golang
  library to reference and merge multiple YAML files into a main one.
* [GoWalker](https://github.com/theirish81/gowalker) (**Golang**): A path
  expression interpreter to navigate data structures, powering a simple template
  engine.
